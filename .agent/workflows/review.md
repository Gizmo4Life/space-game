# Workflow: PR Review

This workflow automates the [Pull Request Review Protocol](/docs/governance/protocol/pull-request-review.md). To ensure architectural integrity, you must first consult the source of truth.

## Instructions

1. **Consult Source Protocol**: Read [pull-request-review.md](/docs/governance/protocol/pull-request-review.md) and execute the steps exactly as defined in the **Architectural Verification** and **Compliance** sections.
2. **Deliver Judgment**: Approve or request changes based on standard pattern adherence.
