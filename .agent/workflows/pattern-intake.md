# Workflow: Pattern Intake

This workflow automates the [Pattern Intake Protocol](/docs/governance/protocol/pattern-intake.md). To ensure strict adherence to the latest standards, you must first consult the source of truth.

## Instructions

1. **Consult Source Protocol:** Read [pattern-intake.md](/docs/governance/protocol/pattern-intake.md) and execute the steps exactly as defined in the **Extraction**, **Materialization**, **Indexing**, and **Judgment** sections.
2. **Execute Protocol:** Follow the protocol steps directly from the source file.
