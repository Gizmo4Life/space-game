# Workflow: Greenfield

This workflow automates the [Greenfield Protocol](/docs/governance/protocol/greenfield.md). To ensure strict adherence to development standards, you must first consult the source of truth.

## Instructions

1. **Consult Source Protocol**: Read [greenfield.md](/docs/governance/protocol/greenfield.md) and execute the steps exactly as defined in the **Planning & Design** and **Implementation Execution** sections.
2. **Execute Modular Verification**: Ensure you run the `test-planning`, `architecture-review`, and `observability-compliance` sub-protocols as required.
