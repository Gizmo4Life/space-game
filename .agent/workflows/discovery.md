# Workflow: Discovery

This workflow automates the [Discovery Protocol](/docs/governance/protocol/discovery.md). To ensure strict adherence to the latest standards, you must first consult the source of truth.

## Instructions

1. **Consult Source Protocol:** Read [discovery.md](/docs/governance/protocol/discovery.md) and execute the steps exactly as defined in the **Perform Crawl**, **Map Patterns**, **Signpost**, and **Nuance Extraction** sections.
2. **Execute Protocol:** Follow the protocol steps directly from the source file.
