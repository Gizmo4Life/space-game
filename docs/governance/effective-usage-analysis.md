# Strategic Analysis: Effective Usage of the Knowledge Graph

This repository has achieved 100% architectural atomicity. Every component—from a line of code in `src/` to a vendor SLA in `external/`—is governed by a formal Knowledge Graph (T1 Landscape -> T2 Capability -> T3 Module -> Pattern/Standard).

## 1. Protocol-Bound Agent Collaboration
AI agents (like Antigravity) should no longer operate on "best guesses."
- **Effectiveness:** When starting a task, the agent MUST be directed to the corresponding protocol in `docs/governance/protocol/`.
- **Outcome:** Predictable, high-quality output that matches the repository's precise geometry.

## 2. Front-Loaded Context Elicitation
The most effective way to use this system is to spend 80% of the time in the **Elicitation** phase.
- **Effectiveness:** Use the Greenfield mode of `capability-elicitation.md` to define **Out of Scope** items and **Success Criteria** before a single line of code is written.
- **Outcome:** Zero scope creep and 100% automated test coverage of business intent.

## 3. Continuous Architectural Reconciliation
Documentation is often stale in other repositories; here, it is a **Quality Gate**.
- **Effectiveness:** The `Documentation Validation` protocol ensures that "Discovery" is a continuous process, not a periodic audit.
- **Outcome:** The Knowledge Graph remains the single source of truth for both humans and machines.

## 4. Rationalizing Legacy (Brownfield)
This system is a powerful "Translation Layer" for legacy code.
- **Effectiveness:** Use the Brownfield discovery mode to map undocumented legacy functions to new patterns.
- **Outcome:** Clear technical debt identification and a structured path for modularization.

## 5. RAG-Optimized Precision
Because of the flat hierarchy and YAML metadata, RAG systems can retrieve context with significantly higher precision.
- **Effectiveness:** Agents can "walk the graph" from a standard to its PADU rating to its specific code pattern.
- **Outcome:** Reduced hallucinations and faster "time-to-first-commit" for new developers.
