## 1. Objective
Ensure structural alignment with the repository's T1 (Landscape), T2 (Capability), and T3 (Module) hierarchy.

## 2. Structural Alignment
- **Verify:** The new code/doc belongs to an existing [T2 Capability].
- **Verify:** The new files are mapped to a [T3 Module].
- **Action:** If no mapping exists, execute [Discovery Protocol](discovery.md) to define new architectural artifacts.

## 3. Pattern Adherence
- **Action:** Audit the proposed structure against the **Preferred (P)** [Patterns] in the relevant [Standard].
- **Verify:** No **Unacceptable (U)** patterns are being introduced.
