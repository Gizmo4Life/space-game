# Capability: Repository Consumption

Governs how the repository is forked, merged, or integrated into external projects while maintaining structural integrity.

## 1. Description
Provides the standards and procedures for different adoption contexts (Greenfield vs. Brownfield), ensuring that the RAG-optimized documentation layer remains functional in the target environment.

## 2. Business Logic
- **Context Selection**: Determining the optimal strategy (Fork/Merge) based on the user's starting point.
- **Baseline Verification**: Ensuring the inherited code matches the source's quality gates.
- **Architectural Mapping**: Establishing a Knowledge Graph in the target project.

## 3. Composition
- [External Pillar](/docs/architecture/module/external-pillar.md)
