# Pillar: Architecture

Global boundaries and primary domain of the AI RAG documentation system.

## 1. System Scope
This system governs the relationship between atomic documentation patterns and physical code implementation. It ensures RAG-optimized knowledge retrieval for autonomous agents.

## 2. Core Capabilities
- **Doc Ingestion:** Maps to [T2 Capabilities] for pattern processing.
- **Graph Orchestration:** Manages cross-linking between pillars.
- **Governance Enforcement:** Orchestrates protocol compliance and structural integrity.
- **Repository Consumption:** Governs forking and merging strategies.
- **Operational Reliability:** Ensures system observability and recovery.



## 3. External Boundaries
- [Gemini API](https://ai.google.dev/): Primary reasoning engine for documentation audits.

## 4. Global Infrastructure
- **Filesystem Graph:** Single-region, flat-file repository topology.
