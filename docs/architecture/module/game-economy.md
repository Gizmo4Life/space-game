# Module: Game Economy

Planetary production/consumption simulation, dynamic pricing, trade transactions, and the competitive ship market.

## 1. Physical Scope
- **Path:** `/src/game/` — `EconomyManager.h/.cpp`, `TradeManager.h/.cpp`, `WorldLoader.h/.cpp`
- **Components:** `components/Economy.h`, `components/CargoComponent.h`, `components/InertialBody.h`, `components/ShipStats.h`, `components/NPCComponent.h`, `AmmoDef`
- **Ownership:** Core Engine Team

## 2. Capability Alignment
- [Capability: Economy](/docs/architecture/capability/economy.md) (T2)
- [Capability: Ship Modular System](/docs/architecture/capability/ship-modular-system.md) (T1) — Refit Fees

## 3. Key Systems
- **EconomyManager**: Orchestrates planetary markets and the persistent ship inventory.
  - **Dynamic Pricing**: Uses factory supply nodes and `hullClassScarcity` to adjust prices. Prices are clamped between 0.1x and 10x of the base price.
  - **Ship Transactions**: `buyShip` and `sellShip` handle vessel ownership. Buying a ship consumes it from the persistent `parkedShips` inventory. Selling a ship adds its hull back to the `scrapyardHulls`.
  - **Competitive Bidding**: Factions list hulls via `DetailedHullBid`. These bids are now generated directly from the `parkedShips` vector, ensuring the shipyard displays actual physical inventory.
  - **Scrapyard Management**: Factions store salvaged and obsolete inventory in `scrapyardModules` and `scrapyardHulls`.
  - **Ship Assembly**: `tryAssembleShips` greedily combines `scrapyardHulls` and `shopModules` into `ShipBlueprint` objects, which are then added to `parkedShips` for sale. This system ensures that faction production of parts eventually results in available ships.
  - **Resource Trading**: `executeTrade` manages commodity buy/sell between player cargo and aggregate planetary stockpiles.
- **TradeManager**: Lightweight singleton for executing fine-grained cargo transactions within the UI.

## 4. Pattern Composition
- [cpp-ecs-component](/docs/developer/pattern/cpp-ecs-component.md) (P) — `PlanetEconomy`, `CargoComponent`, `CreditsComponent`
- [cpp-ecs-system-static](/docs/developer/pattern/cpp-ecs-system-static.md) (P) — `EconomyManager::update`
- [cpp-compiler-driven-refactoring](/docs/developer/pattern/cpp-compiler-driven-refactoring.md) (P) — Mandatory protocol for wide-reaching structural changes.
- [cpp-singleton-manager](/docs/developer/pattern/cpp-singleton-manager.md) (P) — `EconomyManager`, `TradeManager`
- [world-procedural-generation](/docs/developer/pattern/world-procedural-generation.md) (P) — Resource seeding via `WorldLoader`
- [economy-resource-chain](/docs/developer/pattern/economy-resource-chain.md) (P) — Three-tier production chain (Basic -> Refined -> Modular)
- [dna-weighted-infrastructure-expansion](/docs/developer/pattern/dna-weighted-infrastructure-expansion.md) (P) — Faction factory construction based on "Need" and DNA axis bias
- [economy-dynamic-pricing](/docs/developer/pattern/economy-dynamic-pricing.md) (P) — Dynamic assignment of `basePrice` utilizing material costs
- [economy-faction-standards](/docs/developer/pattern/economy-faction-standards.md) (P) — Modular designs compete to become faction standards. Best variants go to `FactionData`, inferior to local scrap yard. Includes **Exceptional** module retention (2+ T3 attributes kept for fleets).
- [economy-arbitrage-logic](/docs/developer/pattern/economy-arbitrage-logic.md) (P) — AI traders move goods between planets based on price differentials and faction DNA
- [economy-competitive-market](/docs/developer/pattern/economy-competitive-market.md) (P) — Faction bid model using `Tier` for tiered pricing
- [economy-refit-fee](/docs/developer/pattern/economy-refit-fee.md) (P) — Installation costs for player refits
- [logic-idempotency](/docs/developer/pattern/logic-idempotency.md) (P)
- [otel-span-instrumentation](/docs/developer/pattern/otel-span-instrumentation.md) (P)

## 4. Telemetry & Observability
- `game.economy.tick` — attributes: `economy.planet_count`
- `game.economy.trade.transaction` — attributes: `economy.credits_transferred`
- `game.economy.factory.build` — attributes: `economy.product_type`, `economy.product_id`, `economy.cost_credits`
- `game.economy.stockpile.delta` — attributes: `faction.id`, `product.id`, `stockpile.delta`
- **Status:** ✅ Fully instrumented via `opentelemetry-cpp`
