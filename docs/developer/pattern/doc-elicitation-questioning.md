## Structure
- **Requirement:** Perform at least 3 layers of "What/Why" questioning to uncover hidden assumptions.
- **Rule:** Question every "standard" or "simple" requirement to find unique contextual constraints.
- **Verify:** The output must be a refined set of limits and constraints, not a longer list of features.
