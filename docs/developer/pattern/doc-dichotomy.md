# Pattern: Pattern/Standard Dichotomy

Effective documentation requires a strict separation between structural definitions and contextual constraints.

## Definitions
- **Pattern (What):** A contextless, platonic geometry or structure. It defines *what* something is without specifying *how* or *when* it should be used.
- **Standard (Should):** A set of rules and contextual nuances. It defines *should* or *must* behavior by referencing patterns and assigning them a status (PADU).
